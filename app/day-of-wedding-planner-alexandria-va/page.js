                  Mrs. Browne came as a recommendation from my wedding cake
                  designer and I couldn't be happier. Ms. Browne was prompt,
                  responsive, and incredibly knowledgeable about flowers and
                  design. She kept me updated and sent texts of her selections
                  from the flower market the week of my wedding. She delivered
                  my flowers the day before my event with thorough care
                  instructions and carefully packaged. I would, and have
                  recommended Ms. Browne for additional events and will be using
                  her for my wedding reception in 2022.

                #4. Do I need a marriage license in Alexandria, VA, and how do I
                get one?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                Yes, you need a marriage license from the Commonwealth of
                Virginia. Both parties must appear in person at the Clerk of the
                Circuit Court in the county where the marriage will be performed
                (in this case, Alexandria). You'll need to provide
                identification and pay a fee. There is no waiting period in
                Virginia, so you can typically get your license and marry on the
                same day. However, the license is only valid for 60 days.
