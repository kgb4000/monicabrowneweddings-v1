                  month of planner and helped us tremendously. Iâ€™m positive that
                  our wedding day wouldnâ€™t have gone as seamlessly as it did if
                  Monica wasnâ€™t there to manage everything. She went above and
                  beyond to make our wedding perfect and we donâ€™t have a single
                  thing we would change about the day. Go ahead and book Monica
                  right now if youâ€™re contemplating a wedding planner!!

                  The best thing I could have done for our daughter's wedding
                  was hire Monica Browne of Monica Brown Weddings to be our
                  Coordinator. A true professional; she is detailed oriented and
                  extremely easy to work with. There are not enough stars to
                  give Monica for a true rating (10 ++++â€¦). She knows exactly
                  what the bride would need and how to go about it. The day of
                  the event, Monica and her team awesome professional. We would
                  highly recommend Monica Browne Weddings!

              <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl my-4">
                #1. What is the typical timeline for full-service wedding
                planning?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                We recommend starting full-service planning anywhere from 12 to
                18 months before your desired wedding date. This allows ample
                time for vendor selection, design development, and securing your
                preferred dates. However, we're experienced in planning weddings
                on shorter timelines too, so don't hesitate to reach out even if
                your date is closer!

              <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl my-4">
                #2. How much does full-service wedding planning cost?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                In the wider DMV (D.C., Maryland, Virginia) area, the cost for
                full-service wedding planning generally ranges from{' '}
                <b>$7,000 to $25,000+</b>, with many couples investing between
                <b>$9,000 and $15,000</b> for comprehensive services. This range
                reflects the extensive support and expertise provided from
                concept to execution.

              <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl my-4">
                #3. Do you work with specific budgets, or is there a minimum?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                We work with a diverse range of budgets and believe beautiful
                weddings can be created at various price points. During our
                initial consultation, we'll discuss your financial comfort zone
                and help you understand how to best allocate your resources to
                achieve your vision. Our aim is always to provide maximum value
                and transparency.

                #4. How do you select your vendors, and can we bring our own?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                We pride ourselves on our network of trusted, professional, and
                reliable wedding vendors in Mitchellville and the surrounding
                areas. Our recommendations are based on proven quality,
                professionalism, and their ability to align with your specific
                style and budget. While we highly recommend our vetted partners,
                we're certainly open to working with vendors you may already
                have in mind, provided they meet our standards of excellence.

                #5 Is full-service planning only for large, elaborate weddings?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                Not at all! While we excel at producing grand celebrations,
                full-service planning is equally valuable for intimate weddings
                and micro-weddings. The benefit isn't just about the size of the
                event, but about the level of support and peace of mind you
                receive. If you want a stress-free experience, regardless of
                guest count, full-service is for you.
