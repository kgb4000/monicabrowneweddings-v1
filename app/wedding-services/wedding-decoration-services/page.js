                #1. Why Should I Consider Hiring a DC Day-of Coordinator?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                You should consider hiring a day-of wedding coordinator if
                you're on a budget.
              </p>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                If you want to do most of the planning yourself and find your
                wedding venue and vendors on your own but still want to enjoy
                your wedding day without worrying about anything, consider
                hiring Monica Browne Weddings.

                #3. When To Hire a Day of Wedding Coordinator?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                The best time to hire a day of wedding coordinator is between
                six to eight weeks before your wedding date.
              </p>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                This leaves enough time to read vendor contracts, do a
                walk-through of the different sites, form a relationship with
                the other vendors, and sort out any missing details that you may
                have missed while planning your event.

                #4. What is the difference between event planner and day of
                coordinator?
              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                The primary difference between an event planner and a day-of
                coordinator lies in the scope of their responsibilities and when
                they get involved.
              </p>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                An event planner is typically hired during the early stages of
                planning, taking charge of the entire process from concept to
                execution. On the other hand, a day-of coordinator is primarily
                focused on the actual day of the event, ensuring that all
                aspects run smoothly and according to plan.

              </h3>
              <p className="md:text-xl mb-4">
                On average, planning a wedding can take anywhere from 100 to 150
                hours, spread over several months or even a year. Factors that
                influence the planning time include the level of customization,
                number of guests, location, and the couple's level of
                involvement in the planning process.
